# BackOrder_LinearDataStructures
This was a project I did in Winter 2017 at Western Washington University for Computer Science 145, Linear Data Structures
The project runs only when the .jar file is included in compilation, also two of the four txt files must be inputted for data,
Books and Transactions or Books1 and Transactions1. The basic idea is that the program reads through the orders (transactions or 
transactions1) and using the inventory of books (Books or Books1) the back orders are compiled for the store using the program.
